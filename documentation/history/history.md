# History

### 2021-07-23
After some time I managed to come back to the project.
I added a simple MainLoop (GameLoop) and thought about the architecture of the engine.
I also created a test project for testing the library.
I'm happy that it was possible to open a window.

Starting slowly by creating a text file reader, and an OpenGL window.

### 2021-07-01
Once again...
After starting some projects with [LWJGL][lwjgl], it's time to extract stuff I'm rewriting every time.
Today the project skeleton was created. 

Note to myself: Next time I start using generated passwords for everything in combination with a KeePass file, be sure to remember that KeePass file password - in case you're re-install your whole system ;)
